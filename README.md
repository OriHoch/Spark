# Spark by Midburn

Spark is "burn in a box" suite of services that composes everything required to run a burn event throughout the year.

It contains:
- Theme Camps (MVP)
- Profiles
- Ticketing
- NGO (non-profit org, members, ...)
- Art Installations
- ... ?

It **does not** contain:
- The Static Website
- Ticket Queue Management (handled by a different system)

Spark is being developed by the Midburn Tech Team, with the purpose of utilizing it to run Midburn 2017, and in the future other regional events. The Minimal Viable Product we're starting with is the Camps system.
